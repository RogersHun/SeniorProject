      "109050    Reviewed by hoppyhound from Ohio3.63/5¬†¬†rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75Ok so let me explain this rating. First you need to understand Korean beer. The big three here are Cass, Hite, and OB. All of them are skunky nasty lagers. There is also an obsession with lagers here. Sweet German and Belgian Beers are all the rage. You can get hoppier beers but they are usually imports and bloody expensive. So this \"Blond Type\" really threw me off at first. I expected a blond ale. I did not get one. I got something better. While I still prefer the extra bitter version of this ale, I have to say this is one of the the only really solid beer I've found that's made in Korea outside of the adjunct lager type. The color is a brilliant amber, the smell is pretty good floral with nice bitter undertones, the taste is a bit confusing at first but really is somewhere between an American IPA and a blonde ale. I'm not sure that British Pale Ale really does it justice, but ok sure I could see it fitting that taste profile. The mouth feel is great actually. I expect Korean beers to be sticky and slightly nasty (sorry I've lived here for the last year, good beer has been largely lacking) This drinks a bit bitter, smooth, no alcohol overtones, not sticky. A great great summer beer. Especially when served at about 40 degrees which is where I prefer most of my summer beers. So this actually would be rated higher if people knew what they were getting when they bought it. I pay about 3,500 won for a 16 oz can here (about 3.46) if they brought this to the USA at a similar price point I would be hesitant. Beer here is much more expensive than in the US. But if they licensed it so I could get it closer to 2 dollars a can in the US? I would drink it often.Jul 01, 2014¬†¬†Report\n",

Mild lemon candy bitterness and some pine. A descent balance.\\nThe texture is fizzy, which takes away from the otherwise nice profile.\\nNot bad if you're looking for a light but flavorful beer.Feb 19, 2014¬†¬†Report\n",

Big foamy head.\\n\\nS: Fruity hops and fudge. Burned caramel. Ooer, nice-uh!\\n\\nT: CARDBOARD, and lots of. The bittering hops are well off the mark. There's a lot of pleasant banana‚Äìlike/solvent/nail varnish, but in a 5.4% beer?!!! It is citrusy and there are hints of woodiness but the flavours simply don't work in harmony.\\n\\nO: Young South Koreans are getting fed up with their domestic piss and are willing to pay more for imports. This is HiteJinro's response to that growing demand - a faux craft beer - and it's not going to cut it.Oct 01, 2013¬†¬†Report\n",
